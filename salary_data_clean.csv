Data Scientist,$96K-$101K (Glassdoor est.),"Intro

Why this job?

1. Work on a product people love that solves real problems: Your friends and family can use Notion to take notes, display photos, collect recipes — while Fortune 500 companies use it to run huge teams (and some non-profits use it to conserve wildlife).
2. Help define what data means at Notion: As the first hire working full-time on data at Notion, you'll have outsized influence on what data infrastructure, data analysis, and data team structure look like as we grow the business.
3. Join us at a magical time: We've hit profitability and product-market fit, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'd join at the perfect time to shape what we build and how we grow.
So, what will you do as a Data Scientist at Notion?
You'll build models to predict things like conversion and likelihood of churn.
You'll build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for making key decisions.
You'll collaborate with team leads across the business to understand and support their data needs.
You'll build and improve our underlying data infrastructure and tooling. (We currently use DBT, Snowflake, Mode Analytics, Fivetran, Census, Amplitude, Segment, and more).
You might be a fit for this role if...
You've spent meaningful time as a senior data scientist — or even better, you've previously managed a team (there's opportunity to do that here).
You have experience building predictive statistical and machine learning models, and you can build reproducible backtests for proposed models to demonstrate their effectiveness.
You have experience building out data infrastructure which facilitates speed, reliability, and scalability.
You are a SQL expert. You have no problem regularly leveraging window functions, UDFs, self-joins, and other complex SQL functions to accomplish your data analysis goals.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You are an expert at making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
You have strong product sense and user intuition which inform the questions you ask of the data you are analyzing.",5.0,"Notion Labs

Data Scientist,$96K-$101K (Glassdoor est.),"Our Mission
We’re here to create a safer, happier and more mindful future for all with the help of data science, engineering, design, and mobile technology. We're starting by reinventing insurance, by rethinking the technologies that enable it, but our true goal is to build a platform that rewards people for driving well — creating safer roads with fewer accidents in the process.

Backed by impressive funding, we're poised to re-engineer a trillion-dollar category, and that’s just the beginning. We’re using rich customer insights, advanced technology and data science to build our cloud-native InsurTech solution, and other things we haven’t even dreamt up yet. We're out to change behavior and promote mindful living at a societal level. But the key to us being successful in our mission isn’t just about nailing the technology—it’s about hiring the talented people who can help us make a quantifiable impact in the world. We’re growing our world-class team. And that’s where you come in.

The data science team builds the data-driven features of the company.

Multi-armed bandit models: You know how to implement the technique and how to write a good cost function.
Modern techniques: You can build a model that powers an app that serves a unique arrangement of diverse components to each user such that the specific components served were chosen to maximize the specific user’s probability of selecting a call to action (i.e. using machine learning to identify complex heterogenous treatment effects).
War stories: You must be able to talk about times you ran experiments in a complex environment and what you learned from the effort
Specific experience in marketing optimization is a plus.
Specialization: Insurance
Industry experience: You have solid P&C experience and have had a significant role in building either pricing or underwriting models.
